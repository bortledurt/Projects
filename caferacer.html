        <h1>Welcome to Cafe Racer</h1>
        <p>Cafe racers are custom motorcycles characterized by their minimalist, retro design. Originating from British motorcycle culture of the 1960s, these bikes are built for speed and agility, reflecting a rebellious spirit and personal style.</p>
        
        <h2>History of Cafe Racers</h2>
        <p>The cafe racer movement began in the post-war UK as young enthusiasts modified their bikes to resemble racing machines. Stripping down bikes to reduce weight, adding performance parts, and creating unique aesthetics were key elements. The culture was tied to the mod and rockers subcultures, with riders racing between cafes, building a distinctive community and style. Today, cafe racers are celebrated for their classic look and connection to motorcycle history.</p>
